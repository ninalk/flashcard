## Introduction 

FLASHED is a personal tool built to help further studying and prepare for interviews. The idea came to me post-graduation when I realized there is still so much to learn and a wealth of resources to pull from. I designed the app with the intention of having a single source to re-visit concepts and learn new ones.

Interesting Features:
1. Swipeable carousel to view flash cards.
2. Toggle answer to questions.
3. Shuffle/randomize flash cards.
4. Add, edit, delete cards.
